        <h2>Description</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        Idli is a popular, soft, spongy South Indian steamed savory cake made from a fermented batter of rice and black lentils (urad dal), known for being light, nutritious, vegan, and easily digestible, typically served hot with sambar and chutney as a breakfast or snack.
    </p>
    <p>
        The fermentation process enhances flavor and nutrients, resulting in a mildly tangy taste and fluffy texture after steaming in molds.
